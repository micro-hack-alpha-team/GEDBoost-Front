## Solution Description
The solution focuses on automating the parameterization phase of GED by providing a user-friendly interface for specifying parameters and generating configurations. By leveraging React's dynamic UI capabilities and Tailwind CSS for styling, the application offers a seamless experience for engineers and designers to input parameters and obtain configurations effortlessly.

## Features
- **Dynamic Parameter Input**: Users can input various parameters required for GED.
- **Configurations Generation**: The application automatically generates configurations based on the provided parameters.
- **Intuitive UI**: Built with React, the UI is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS ensures that the application is responsive and works across different screen sizes.
